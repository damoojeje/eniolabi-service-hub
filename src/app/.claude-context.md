# App Directory Context (Next.js App Router)

## Purpose
Next.js 14 App Router pages and layouts. Each folder represents a route.

## Structure
```
app/
├── layout.tsx          # Root layout (providers, fonts, metadata)
├── page.tsx           # Homepage (redirects to dashboard)
├── auth/signin/       # Authentication pages
├── dashboard/         # Main dashboard page  
├── admin/            # Admin panel page
├── notifications/    # Notification settings
└── api/              # API routes
```
